# What a nice API

## What is it ?

What a nice API is an API build for spreading love, use it in your app to, greet customers, make a tweet bot, call a taxi (I don't know).

## Notice

This is in the process of being rebuild, the original code is on the `master` branch, if you are interested.

More to come.
